# ⌨️ Typing Speed Tester – Python GUI App

This is a **Python-based GUI app** that tests your typing speed, accuracy, and performance using random sentences. Built using `Tkinter`, it provides real-time feedback in words per minute (WPM), characters per minute (CPM), and typing accuracy.

---

## ✅ Features

- Displays a random sentence for typing
- Starts timer as soon as you focus on the input box
- Press Enter to view your results:
  - ⏱️ Time taken
  - ⌨️ Words per Minute (WPM)
  - 🔠 Characters per Minute (CPM)
  - 🎯 Accuracy (in %)

---

## 🧠 What You Learn from This

- GUI design with `tkinter`
- Real-time interaction using events (`<FocusIn>`, `<Return>`)
- Measuring time using `time.time()`
- Calculating speed and accuracy
- String and character comparison logic

---

## 💻 How to Run

1. Make sure Python 3 is installed
2. Save the file as `typing_speed_test.py`
3. Run the script:

```bash
python typing_speed_test.py
```

4. The GUI will open, and your typing test will begin.

## 🧪 Example Output

```text
🕒 Time: 10.25s | ⌨️ WPM: 36 | 🔠 CPM: 205 | 🎯 Accuracy: 92%
```

## 📦 Technologies Used

- Python 3.x
- `tkinter` for GUI
- `time` for performance tracking
- `random` for selecting test sentences
